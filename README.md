## UX

For this site, extensive research was conducted on existing wedding photography websites to understand their design and usability. The goal is to provide a user-friendly interface that is not only easy to navigate but also immerses visitors in the wedding atmosphere. The chosen design evokes positive associations with the wedding day, enhancing the overall user experience.

- `#fafafa` and `#ececece5` used for secondary text.
