## UX

For this site, extensive research was conducted on existing wedding photography websites to understand their design and usability. The goal is to provide a user-friendly interface that is not only easy to navigate but also immerses visitors in the wedding atmosphere. The chosen design evokes positive associations with the wedding day, enhancing the overall user experience.

### Colour Scheme

The colors have been chosen based on popular wedding themes and hues that contrast well with each other, ensuring a user-friendly interface that is easy to read.


- `#3a3a3a` used for primary text.
- `#877f57` used for primary highlights.
- `#fafafa` and `#ececece5` used for secondary text.
- `#a39a6b` and `#532c00` used for secondary highlights.

I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/e84610-009fe3-4a4a4f-445261-d63649-e6ecf0-000000) to generate my colour palette.

### Typography

- [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) was used for all other secondary text.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site, such as the social media icons in the footer.
